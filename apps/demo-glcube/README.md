Simple demo showcasing rotating cube using WebGL.
Uses internal 600-character matrix library and no engine.
Fitting it into QR code was not easy nor pretty, some parts of code are not very readable.
Building more complex WebGL app would likely require different approach (shaders?)
or more agressive minifying/uglifying
