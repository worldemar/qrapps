Demo showcasing interactive fragment shader using WebGL.
Displays julia set with pan, zoom and ability to move constant point by drag-and-drop.

Worst thing about shaders - they cannot be minified automatically.
This forces manual "minification" which results in VERY unreadable code.
Loading external shader file is rather difficult to implement within Data URL.
