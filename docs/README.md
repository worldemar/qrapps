# QR Code Apps

## What is it?
Collection of miniature apps/minigames that fit into a single QR code.
All apps follow same rules:

- **Fit within single QR code**. Any tricks are okay as long as QR code is scannable.
- **Do not require any external resources**. Apps are fully operable if scanned from paper ("hard copy") without internet connection on scanning device.

## How to use?
These codes can be scanned by your device of choice and content pasted directly into browser URL.
Since QR code content is [Data URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme), it contains everything needed within itself.

## Why would you do that?
For fun, challenge and as a demonstration of modern browser capabilities.
Fitting entire app in one QR code also keeps them relatively small and simple... until author tries to squeeze code too hard and it becomes unreadeable ðŸ˜‚

This is also a good source of compact code examples. Some of them were inspired by examples I had found, but stripped down from all the fluff and simplified. Instead of including some 10kb+ libraries and then having 3-line example, these are within 200 lines of code and nothing is hidden from you.

## How does it work?
Each app is HTML/JS/CSS webpage contained within own directory in `apps`. Scripts `qr.py` and `qrs.py` will convert each app into [QR code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) by 'minifying'/'uglyfying' it and inlining all JS/CSS/whatever into single HTML. This HTML then encoded as [Data URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme) and QR code of said URL is generated.

## Collection of QR apps!

### [demo-canvas](demo-canvas/index.html)

Simple demo showcasing mouse tracking and canvas drawing

### [demo-clock](demo-clock/index.html)

Simplest demo showcasing proof-of-concept.

### [demo-geometry](demo-geometry/index.html)

Geometry demo inspired by old ZX Spectrum demoscene.

### [demo-glcube](demo-glcube/index.html)

Simple demo showcasing rotating cube using WebGL.
Uses internal 600-character matrix library and no engine.
Fitting it into QR code was not easy nor pretty, some parts of code are not very readable.
Building more complex WebGL app would likely require different approach (shaders?)
or more agressive minifying/uglifying

### [demo-shader](demo-shader/index.html)

Simple demo showcasing fragment shader using WebGL.
Contains minimal (about 50 lines, just over 1kb compressed) of boilerplate code to run single fragment shader.
Mandelbrot set shader added for demonstration purposes based on [WebGL101](https://github.com/emoller/WebGL101) fragment shader example. Controls are cursor keys, `+` and `-`.

### [demo-shader-julia](demo-shader-julia/index.html)

Demo showcasing interactive fragment shader using WebGL.
Displays julia set with pan, zoom and ability to move constant point by drag-and-drop.

Worst thing about shaders - they cannot be minified automatically.
This forces manual "minification" which results in VERY unreadable code.
Loading external shader file is rather difficult to implement within Data URL.

### [spectrogram](spectrogram/index.html)

A relatively straightforward implementation of spectrogram.
The QR for this app might be rather useless, since `mediaDevices`
are only available for HTTPS on Android devices and not available
for Data URL on any platform I have available.
